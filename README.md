### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Maya Cortez Espinoza and I am currently a PhD researcher in the Department of German Linguistics at Graz University in Austria.
On my profile, you can find a repository with the software for a Linguistic study we conducted in the Project "The erotetic and the aesthetic". 

I am very much looking forward to new projects and collaborations.
